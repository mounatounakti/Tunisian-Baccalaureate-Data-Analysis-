### Data Visualization  
![1](https://github.com/mounatounakti/Tunisian-Baccalaureate-Data-Analysis-/blob/df08fccb8ccca228801c526f76c43f67d8b115ef/src/1.png)  
â†’ Candidate numbers have fluctuated over the last decade, peaking in 2021. There was a steady decline after 2014 before the sudden jump in 2021.

â†’ Across Tunisia, female students consistently outperform male students in the Baccalaureate exam, making up nearly two-thirds of all successful candidates.

â†’ The gender mix of candidates has changed dramatically. In 2010, 86% of candidates were female; by 2022 the gap narrowed, with males making up 65% of candidates.  
**ðŸ’¡Insight:** Not only are females more successful, but their share among candidates has been volatile.  

![4](https://github.com/mounatounakti/Tunisian-Baccalaureate-Data-Analysis-/blob/df08fccb8ccca228801c526f76c43f67d8b115ef/src/3.png)  
â†’ Coastal governorates like Tunis (20% success) and Sousse (17%) show stronger results, while interior regions like Siliana or BÃ©ja lag behind.  
**ðŸ’¡Insight:** The difference in success between interior and coastal regions reflects broader educational and socio-economic gaps. 

![5](https://github.com/mounatounakti/Tunisian-Baccalaureate-Data-Analysis-/blob/df08fccb8ccca228801c526f76c43f67d8b115ef/src/5.png)  
â†’ In the early years (2010â€“2013) thereâ€™s a wide gap, with a high success rate and relatively low adjourned/refused percentages. 
Over the middle period the success rate steadily declines while adjourned and refused shares grow, reflecting tougher exams or changing conditions.   
In the last two years the trend reverses, with success climbing again as adjourned and refused percentages fall.  

![6](https://github.com/mounatounakti/Tunisian-Baccalaureate-Data-Analysis-/blob/df08fccb8ccca228801c526f76c43f67d8b115ef/src/6.png)  
â†’ More than 476,000 students study Economics and Management, which is more than any other subject. 
Literature and Experimental Sciences also have many students. 
Sportand Math have fewer students.  
**ðŸ’¡Insight:** Students avoid science tracks and choose the Economics track because it is easier.

![7](https://github.com/mounatounakti/Tunisian-Baccalaureate-Data-Analysis-/blob/df08fccb8ccca228801c526f76c43f67d8b115ef/src/7.png)
- **Sport**
  - Highest success rate of all (over 20%)
  - Very low refusal rate
- **Math & Literature**
  - Moderate success
  - Literature has higher refusal than Math
- **Economics & Management**
  - Lower success than expected given its popularity
  - One of the highest refusal rates
- **Technique**
  - Solid success
  - Balanced adjourned/refused rates
- **Computer Experimental**
  - Lowest success among all tracks

**ðŸ’¡Insight:** Sport and Math perform best in success percentage. While, Computer Experimental and Economics & Management show the greatest struggle.

â†’ Student preferences for Bac specializations have shifted: Technique jumped from 26% to 68%, Eco & Management rose from 27% to 73%, while Computer Experimental dropped from 61% to 39%.  
**ðŸ’¡Insight:** Economic/technical tracks are becoming more attractive, while traditional science/IT streams are losing share.

### Conclusion  
â†’ The study provides a clear overview of Baccalaureate data in Tunisia.  
â†’ Charts are kept simple and effective for easier interpretation.  
â†’ With official, centralized data, the analysis could go deeper and extend beyond 2022 up to 2025.
